## ¿Why?

Each team member is looking to improve his game development and temawork skills, so we decided to start this non profit game as a personal project.

We choose this type of game because fighting games are one of the most difficult genres to develop. It has a very complex use of animations, state machines, camera and cinematics, physics, collisions, input system, multiplayer, etc.
